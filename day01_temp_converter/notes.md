# Day 01
In this challenge i was tasked with creating a program that takes input from the user to convert a specified degree that is either in fahrenheit or celcius to its correspoding temperature in celcius or fahrenheit respectively

This project reinforced my understanding of enums, the `?` operator for error handling and structs. 

I also stumbled accross a new concept that i think i missed because i didn't do chapter 2 of the rust book. The concept involves taking input from the users via the console.

I also learned about the `.parse()` that converts a string to an integer
